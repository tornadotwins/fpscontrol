Hallways and Rooms modular assets:

The base are the hallway meshes. These come in a 2 main variations:
1-sided and 2-sided.

Whenever you want to add a room just place a 1-sided hallway mesh (just floor and wall/windows/fake door) and place a room on the other side (has walls and a door-way that leads into a room). From that room you can add other rooms to the sides or behind it and from that room you can connect back to the hallway.

This way you have a large amount of control of the layout. You can continue building hallways and rooms and connect rooms to other rooms and the hallway. 
This might be a bit tricky to get used to so if anything is unclear or if you have any questions just give me a shout, either email or skype me (username: danne_da_don on skype).
